# Part 1. Use the mpg dataset that comes with dplyr for the following exercises. 
# 1. How would you plot the relationship between cty (average city mileage) and hwy
# (average highway mileage)




# 2. colour the points to match the different levels of the variable class




# 3. Investigate how the distribution of hwy (average highway mileage) varies with the type of drv (drive train)
# start with looking at one variable at a time





# 4. Explore how many records are available for every care manufacturer represented in the dataset








# Part 2. Use the economics dataset to explore the following:
# https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/economics.html

# 1. Get to know the dataset. How many rows and columns are there?
# What is the class of each variable?

# The economics dataset is comprised of:
# date - month of data collection
# psavert - personal savings rate 
# pce -personal consumption expenditures in billions of dollars
# unemploy - number of unemployed in thousands
# unempmed - median duration of unemployment in weeks
# pop total population in thousands. 


# 2. Plot the unemployment rate (# of unemployed / population)








# 3. Change the theme (visual elements) of the plot 
# Add a title to the plot. Change the x and y axis labels to be Unemployment Rate and Date.
