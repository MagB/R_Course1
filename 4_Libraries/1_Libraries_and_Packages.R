# One of the major benefits of R is that many common routines and algorithms have been packed.
# Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code all organized in a well-defined format. 
# The directory where packages are stored is called the library. 
# R comes with a standard set of packages. 
# Up to this point I've used the term base R. This is the set of functions etc within the base R package. 
# We don't have to call or load the base R package as it comes standard with R
# Others packages are available for download and installation. 
# Once installed, they have to be loaded into the session to be used.
# Outside of STATCAN you would go to the CRAN repository site to find the package you want and install. 

# For security, IT services maintains a mirror of the CRAN site and we can access it as follows:







# In the last decade the number of packages available has just exploded. 
# It may seem that it may be difficult to find the right package for your task. 
# The main pacakges needed for an analyst or data scientist are all within what is called the tidyverse. 
# These packages help ease and speed typical data science/analytics work.


#  Let's install and call up the three packages we will be using for the remainder of this course. 
# dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2
